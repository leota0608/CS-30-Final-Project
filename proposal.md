## General Overview
<b>What is looks like:</b>  
Two or more people can play the game. For each turn, there are [three phases](#game-phases) for each player, and players take turns to play. The last player alive is the winner. The game requires combat, strategy, and thinking.


### Game Phases
1. <b>Draw Phase</b>
In this phase, the player in this turn draws `2` cards from the top of the deck of cards, and add them to the player's [`hand cards`](#hand-cards).
2. <b>Action Phase</b>
In this phase, the player in this turn can play cards to attack, heal, or use `trick cards` ([More information about types of cards](#types-of-cards)). If other player(s) got attacked, they can choose to play certain cards to defend.
3. <b>Discard Phase</b>
In this phase, the player in this turn discards his(her) [`hand cards`](#hand-cards) so that the number of `hand cards` is equal to the player's current [`health points`](#health-points)(if number of current hand cards is greater than the player's health points).
### Types Of Cards
**Basic Cards:**  
    - `Slash`: attack card, needs `Dodge` to deflect, or used in `duel` or `savage`
    - `Dodge`: defence card, can't be used directly, can deflect `Dodge` or used in `archery`
    - `Peach`: healing card, can be used by player in action phase or when just got killed
