## Development Work

Requirements:  
Create a development.md file for your project and include the following things. 
- An initial plan as to how you will code your project (may be in the form of a flowchart or pseudocode)
You can make things that outside a .md file as needed. For example you can draw a flow chart on paper.
- List of coding tasks to complete (for group projects, tasks must be assigned to group members). For           procedural programming, list all of the procedures you plan on using. For object-oriented programming, list all of the objects you plan on using.
- Create a timeline for when you need to complete project milestones. Make sure to include time in your schedule for alpha testing and beta testing (this includes creating a checklist, survey or some form of feedback).
Start a changelog where you document programming fixes, additions, and removals. The changelog can be a  text document or a spreadsheet. (create a chagelog.md file in your project)
