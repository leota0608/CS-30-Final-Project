Perfect. Court Piece is played with standard playing cards.
First, cards must be shuffled. Then a card is given to each player
until one of the players gets an ace. This lucky player will
be the "king".

Then, the king is given, five playing cards, and they must choose
the "trump". I do not mean the US president though. Trump is a
kind of card like spade, club, heart or diamond. It must be present
among your cards. Later on you would learn what trump can really do!

Then we distribute the cards among the players. Each player would get
an equal number of cards.

The king starts the game by choosing a card and placing it in the middle.
Then each player, from left would play a card. The card that you play
must be of the same kind as the first person's card.(In this case
the king) The person who played the highest rank would win. Then the
winner starts the next round similar to the above.

Note: If you do not have the same kind of card as the starting player,
do not worry. Here you can play a trump. Congratulations, you will then
always win as long as nobody else played a trump of higher rank than you.
If you do not have any trump card, then you can play any card. Though, you
will never win in this case. So sad!

At the end, the person who won the highest number of round will win.
Four player Court Piece is usually 7 rounds, three player is 9 and two player
is 11.
