Perfect. In Hearts, first all the cards are thoroughly shuffled.
Then 13 cards is given to each of the four players.
Then each player would hand over 3 of their cards to the player
on their left.

Then, the player, who had the Two of Spade would start the game. The starter
would put a card from their deck on the table. Then other players on the clockwise
order would play their cards. Note that the subsequent cards must have the
suit(kind) as the starting card. If you do not have that kind of
card, then you may play any other card.

Once that all four players played their cards, the player who put the
highest ranking card with the same suit as the first player
would win those cards. They would also get a score based on those
cards. For every Heart, they get a score of 1, and for the
Queen of Spade they get 13.

You will play 13 rounds and at the end the player who has the
lowest score wins. Thus, you have to play for your self and be
very selfish in this game!!
