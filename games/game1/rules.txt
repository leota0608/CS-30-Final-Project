Draw Phase
At the start of each turn, the active player draws 2 cards from the deck. If the deck has fewer than 2 cards remaining, 
the game ends immediately and the surviving player with the human player (player 1) wins if still alive.
Action Phase
During this phase, players can play cards from their hand in any order until they choose to end their turn:

- Basic Cards: "Slash" attacks an opponent (limited to once per turn unless equipped with crossbow), requiring them to play
"dodge" or lose 1 health. "Peach" heals 1 health point if not at maximum health. "Dodge" can only be used defensively when
attacked.
- Equipment Cards: Weapons like "crossbow" (removes slash limit)
"crossblade" can be equipped to the weapon slot, replacing
any previously equipped weapon.
- Trick Cards: "Duel" challenges an opponent to alternately play slashes until someone cannot respond. "Dismantle" destroys 
an opponent's card. "Snatch" steals an opponent's card. "Archery" forces all other players to play dodge or lose health. 
"Savage" forces all other players to play slash or lose health. 
"Benevolence" allows drawing 2 additional cards. 
"Negate" can counter trick cards played against you.

Discard Phase
If a player holds more cards than their maximum hand size (equal to current health), they must discard down to the 
limit. Players eliminated during any phase can use "peach" from their hand to survive with 1 health, otherwise they
are removed from the game.
