**Game Rules**
The game is divided up into three phases:
Draw Phase:
At the start of each turn, the active player draws 2 cards from the deck, and add them to the player's handcards.

Action Phase:
During this phase, players can play cards from their handcards in any order until they choose to end their turn:

Discard Phase:
If a player holds more cards than their maximum handcard number (equal to current health), they must discard down to the 
limit. Players eliminated during any phase can use "peach" from their hand to survive with 1 health, otherwise they die.

Your goal is to beat all other players and win the game.
