These steps to improve our code:
1) Use comments instead of spaces between blocks of code.
2) Add docstring and comments to explain the code.
3) Add header for each python module.
4) Use if __name__ == "__main__" for each run file.
5) Make the information to be printed at a slower rate.
6) Use flushing to remove unwanted information from terminal.
7) Pause the player, so they can follow the logic of the game and confirm.
8) Use indentation when printing to make things clearer.
9) Let the user repeat a game.
10) Add option so that the player can get out of a game by
paying or losing a body part.
