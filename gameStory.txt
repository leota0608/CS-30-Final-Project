You, like every other player, are here because you had
a very high debth that you should pay. Do not cry remember when
when you were doing every thing to get money from the Boss.
You said you will 100x in less than a year and then where is that?
You eaither gonna pay off our moeny or we will take your whole body instead.

To get out safe and clean of every debth, you have to play
four games. If you do not know how to play each game we have game asistants
that would help you get settled.
The games I am talking about are so random that the chance of you living
to the end is small, so do not try so hard.

Losing in any game comes at the cost of losing a body part. Though you buy
a body part and fix your self if you had enough money to do so. 
At the end we at END OF THE WORLD ARCADE are so happy to sell your body
parts and make money off it.
